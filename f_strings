# A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data.
# Every method is followed by a set of parentheses because methods may need additional info to work.
# The 'title' method will title case a string.
name = 'ada lovelace'
print(name.title())

# 'upper' method capitalizes everything
print(name.upper())

# 'lower' method lower cases everything. The 'lower' method is useful for storing data.
print(name.lower())

first_name = 'ada'
last_name = 'lovelace'
# To insert a variables value into a string, place the letter 'f' immediately before the quotation marks
# Then place variable names in curly bracers. Python will replace each variable with its value.
# This is called an 'f-string'. The f stands for format.
full_name = f'{first_name} {last_name}'
print(full_name)

# You can put the f-string in a print command
print(f'Hello, {full_name.title()}!')

# You can also use f-strings to compose a message, and then assign the entire message to a variable.
message = f'Hello, {full_name.title()}!'
print(message)
